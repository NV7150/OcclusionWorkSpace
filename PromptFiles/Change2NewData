I made a change in this Mixed Reality(MR) project:
Previously, the OcclusionProvider interface only gets the frame data(includes imu, rgb, depth), but I added the new arg that is a depth frame of current MR scene.

To implement this interface, I need a 3 new things:
1. Systems/ContentsDepthCal.py
    This calcurates the current depth map of MR contents.
    Get the contents that trying to render in Systesms/Renderer.py.
    The depth map is from only 3D object that trying to overlay in the camera scene.
    Returns np.ndarray, that size is equal to Frame class's width and height trying to render on.
2. Occlusions/SimpleOcclusion.py
    Provide the occlusion map of simply judge from the real camera depth is front/beside of the contents.
3. Load from depth
    Current system loads the depth from png file, but it changed to csv.
    Please adopt that.
    The data example is in LocalData/TestDepth, and sample is in Example/depth_viewer.py.

Please check the project first, and grasp the construction.
You MUST NOT do more things than I specified, like fixing the bugs in other files.
And please do a edit in 1 time in solo file not to waste my tokens.
