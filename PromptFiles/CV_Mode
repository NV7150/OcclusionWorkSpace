For the debug, I want to add "OpenCV Coordinate Mode" In VisualizeModelRenderer. It uses the coordinate system of OpenCV, that is Y-down, Z-forward, right-handed coordinate system.
To do this, please add "cv_coordinate" bool param in initalize method parameter, and if it is specified, please treat every coordinate as CV coordinate.

Please read VisualizeSystem.md and PromptFiles/VisualizeSystem to grap what the visualize system is.

In development, please make sure following:
- Minimize the token, DO NOT make multiple changes in solo file.
- DO NOT use any default values or mock. Please ask me if you find anything I've not defined.
- If you want add files more than I specified, please ask me.
- Make it readable and simple.
- If you have any questions of this project or task, please feel free to ask me.
