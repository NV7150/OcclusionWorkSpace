This MR system is not adopt to tracking.
So I want you to do to do the task below:

1. Basic tracker adoption
In Interfaces/Track.py there is a interface class of Tracker. Please Leverage the tracker interface in the BaseSystem/Renderer.py.

2. Implement Apriltag tracking
Extending Tracker, please wirte a Tracker/ApriltagTracker.py that calicurates camera pose with pupil-apriltags. 
The tracker gets the grand-truth marker position from json file. The information should be pass in initialize() method.

3. Implement json loader
For ApriltagTracker.py, please implement the json loader. The json is like this:
```
{
    "{id}":{
        "pos": [{x}, {y}, {z}],
        "norm": [{x}, {y}, {z}]
    }
}
```
And the example is in LocalData/qr_pos.json. Please refer that.
Please check the project first, and grasp the construction.
You MUST NOT do more things than I specified, like fixing the bugs in other files.
And please do a edit in 1 time in solo file not to waste my tokens.
