In this system, I'm working on occlusion in MR. 
Please refer BaseSsytem.md and PromptFiles/parameters first, and grasp the project.

For debugging, I want to grasp the MR scene.
To do this, I want to implement "visualize mode" in this BaseSystem.
I have a scene 3D scan .fbx file (example is LocalData/SceneModel/on_the_desk.fbx), so please set this model in the origin of the OpenGL visualization.

On the scene model, please render the following information of the scene:
- Refernence markers
    - The markers that using for tracking.
    - Load the marker json file (refer the parameters) and visualize the marker position with plane, norm/tangent vector with arrow.
- Camera positions
    - Estimate camera position/rotation with ApriltagTracker.py of all frames, and render the view fustrums of each frames.
    - Please load the frames like Example/TrakcerExample.py.
- MR Contents
    - Load the Scene json file and contents .fbx file, and put the MR contents in the 3D scan scene.


So you should make "VisualizeSystem.py" and "VisualizeModelRender.py" in Systems folder to do this, and create "VisualizeExample" in the Example folder.

Please make the visualization system that can I explore the the scene in mouse or keyboard.

In development, please make sure following:
- Minimize the token, DO NOT make multiple changes in solo file.
- DO NOT use any default values or mock. Please ask me if you find anything I've not defined.
- If you want add files more than I specified, please ask me.
- Make it readable and simple.
- If you have any questions of this project or task, please feel free to ask me.
