# What is this
The workspace for Occlussion <br>
Coded with Roo Code: https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code

# Directories
- `/PromptFiles` : Prompt that used for Roo Code
- `/Systems`: Basic system of rendering, creating test images, etc.
- `/Interfaces`: Interface of algorithms and DataModels. It is defined for consistency with the AI generated code
- `/Occlusions`: Occlusion algorithms
- `/LocalData`: The localdata do not commited, need to get localy
