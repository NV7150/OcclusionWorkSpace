# MR Occlusion Framework Refactoring Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of refactoring the MR Occlusion Framework according to the plan outlined in `RefactorPlan.md`. The refactoring aims to improve code organization, reduce duplication, enhance maintainability, and adopt modern OpenGL practices.

## Steps Completed

### 1. Define Core Interfaces

✅ Created interfaces in the `core/` directory:
- `IFrameLoader.py`
- `IModel.py`
- `IOcclusionProvider.py`
- `IRenderer.py`
- `IScene.py`
- `ITracker.py`

### 2. Implement Utilities

✅ Established `Utils/` directory for shared utility modules:
- `TransformUtils.py`: Centralized transformation logic for 3D operations

### 3. Develop Models Subsystem

✅ Implemented key files in the `Models/` directory:
- `Model.py`: Unified 3D model data structure
- `Mesh.py`: Individual mesh component of a Model
- `Material.py`: Material properties
- `BaseAssetLoader.py`: Abstract base class for model file loaders
- `FbxLoader.py`: Loads FBX files
- `ObjLoader.py`: Loads OBJ files
- `SceneManager.py`: Manages scene graph

### 4. Develop Rendering Subsystem

✅ Completed implementation of files in the `Rendering/` directory:
- `BufferManager.py`: Manages OpenGL buffer objects (VBOs, EBOs, VAOs)
- `Framebuffer.py`: Manages OpenGL framebuffer objects
- `Primitives.py`: For drawing basic shapes
- `ShaderManager.py`: Added proper logger integration, fixed parameter handling
- `TextureManager.py`: Added proper logger integration, improved API, enhanced error handling
- `Camera.py`: Existing file working with refactored system
- `Renderer.py`: Created (based on OpenGLRenderer.py) as the main rendering class
- `VisualizationRenderer.py`: Specialized renderer for visualization purposes

### 5. Refactor DataLoaders

✅ Implemented files in the `DataLoaders/` directory:
- `Frame.py`: Moved from Interfaces
- `BaseFrameLoader.py`: Abstract base class
- `UniformedFrameLoader.py`: Current data loader implementation

### 6. Refactor Concrete Implementations

✅ Moved and refactored implementations:

Created `Trackers/` directory and moved files:
- `ApriltagTracker.py`

Created `OcclusionProviders/` directory:
- `BaseOcclusionProvider.py`: Abstract base class for occlusion providers
- `DepthThresholdOcclusionProvider.py`: Refactored from Occlusions/DepthThresholdOcclusion.py
- `DepthGradientOcclusionProvider.py`: Extracted from Occlusions/DepthThresholdOcclusion.py
- `SimpleOcclusionProvider.py`: Refactored from Occlusions/SimpleOcclusion.py

### 7. Refactor Systems

✅ Refactored systems in the `Systems/` directory:
- `OcclusionSystem.py`: Refactored from Systems/BaseSystem.py
- `OcclusionProcessor.py`: New component that replaces ContentsDepthCal functionality
- `VisualizeSystem.py`: Refactored to use the new architecture

### 8. Update Examples

✅ Created example code to demonstrate the new architecture:
- `Example/refactored_example.py`: Shows how to use the refactored framework

### 9. Documentation

✅ Created documentation for the refactored framework:
- `README_REFACTORED.md`: Explains the new architecture and how to use it

## All Tasks Completed ✅

All refactoring tasks have been completed according to the plan outlined in `RefactorPlan.md`. The refactored framework now has:

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a well-defined responsibility
2. **Interface-Based Design**: Components interact through interfaces, allowing for easy substitution
3. **Dependency Injection**: Components receive their dependencies through constructors
4. **Centralized Resource Management**: Shared resources like OpenGL buffers are managed centrally
5. **Improved Modularity**: Components can be easily replaced or extended
6. **Enhanced Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
7. **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand and modify
8. **Increased Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts
9. **Optimized Performance**: Centralized resource management improves performance
10. **Greater Extensibility**: New occlusion algorithms, renderers, etc. can be easily added

## Technical Notes

- The refactored `ShaderManager` and `TextureManager` now accept a logger instance for consistent logging.
- The new `Renderer` class integrates ShaderManager, TextureManager, BufferManager, etc., for a unified approach.
- The BufferManager abstraction helps avoid duplicate OpenGL state management.
- The OcclusionProcessor provides a flexible way to use multiple occlusion providers with different combination methods.
- TransformUtils centralizes all 3D transformation logic that was previously duplicated across multiple files.
- The VisualizationRenderer implements the IRenderer interface but is specialized for visualization purposes.
